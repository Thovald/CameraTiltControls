<h2>Camera Tilt Controls</h2>

Exposes a few settings to tilt the camera upwards.<br>
This is different from simply orbiting the camera.<br>
<br>
Normally, the camera is pointed at your character's head.<br>
By tiliting it upwards, it will point at an imaginary point above your character, giving you a better view of what's in front.<br>
Particularly useful for ranged specs who would otherwise have to lower the camera to see forward!<br>

Keep in mind that you might have to shift some interface elements around to compensate for your character's new location on your screen.<br>
